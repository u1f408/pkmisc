# iris' misc pluralkit stuff

## imggrab

Python script to mass grab images linked from a PluralKit export JSON file.

This script will grab avatars/icons (including proxy avatars for members)
and banners, for your system + members + groups, outputting them all into
a folder named after your system's short ID (the 5 character random ID).

No dependencies outside of the Python standard library, just grab and run.
